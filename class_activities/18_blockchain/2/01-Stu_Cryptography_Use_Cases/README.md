# Cryptography Use Cases

In this activity, you will be researching different use cases of cryptography, and relating them to how you may have used cryptography before.

## Instructions

With groups up to three people in size, research and discuss the following:

* What is Cryptography?


    * practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries
    * More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages;
    * concerned with: data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation[4] are central to modern cryptography.
    * modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics

* What is a Digital Signature?
    * Digital Signature is a process that guarantees that the contents of a message have not been altered in transit.
    * When you, the server, digitally sign a document, you add a one-way hash (encryption) of the message content using your public and private key pair. Your client can still read it, but the process creates a "signature" that only the server's public key can decrypt. 
    * The client, using the server's public key, can then validate the sender as well as the integrity of message contents. 

* What is Encryption?
    * Encryption is the process in which a message is encoded in a format that cannot be read or understood by an external party lacking the necessary credentials.

* What is PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)?
    * it allows you to send a coded message to someone without having to share the code beforehand.
    * PGP’s core function is to enable its users to send secure messages without needing a prior introduction, but that’s not all it does. It also allows recipients to verify whether a message is authentic or if it has been tampered with. It does this by using something called digital signatures, which we will cover later in the article.
    * new versions of PGP have continually been released to improve its security and its usability

Talk with your partners about how you may have used cryptography in your life.

* Why types of services use cryptography?
    * anything on the internet
    * exchanges

* Would you trust these services without the use of cryptography?
    * NO

Write down your answers to the above questions and be prepared to share them with the class.
